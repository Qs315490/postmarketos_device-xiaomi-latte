# Remove this file if unnecessary (CHANGEME!)
# This file shall contain a list of modules to be included in the initramfs,
# so that they are available in early boot stages. In general, it should
# include modules to support unlocking FDE (touchscreen, panel, etc),
# USB networking, and telnet in the debug-shell.
# The format is one module name per line. Lines starting with the character
# '#', and empty lines are ignored. If there are multiple kernel variants
# with different initramfs module requirements, one modules-initfs.$variant
# file should be created for each of them.
